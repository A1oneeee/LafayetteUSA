### Note Part 1️⃣
**Data analysis**: A process of inpecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.

Two options for data analysis : 
- **Auto-managed closed tools** (closed source, expensive, limited, easy to learn)
- **Programming languages** (open source, free, extremly powerful, steep learning curve)

**Why Python in Data Analysis ?** (over R ou Julia)

- Very simple and intuitive lg, powerfull lbries, free and open source, community

**Data analysis Process** 
- Data extraction
- Data cleaning
- Data Wrangling
- Analysis
- Action

**Data Analysis Vs Data Science** 
1. Data Scientcs is more about programming and math skills
2. Data analysis have better communication skills, better reports with stronger storytelling abilities
